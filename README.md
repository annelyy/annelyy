### Hi, I'm annelyy ðŸ‘‹

As a current graduate student from Northeastern University's Information Systems program, I am excited to utilize my technical skills and passion for customer satisfaction to develop innovative products that positively impact people's lives. With my background in Psychology from Fudan University in China, I understand the significance of customer experience and the role that technology plays in shaping it. My expected graduation date is in 2024, and I am eager to contribute my knowledge and expertise to create solutions that enhance customer satisfaction. I believe that the intersection of technology and psychology offers endless possibilities, and I am thrilled to be a part of this dynamic field.
